    <h1>Obi Wan Kenobi</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi/Legends">Obi Wan Kenobi</a>
         is a Star Wars character whose story spans from the prequels to the original Triology. His significance
         weaves with the Jedi council, the fates of many main characters, and his very own padawan, Anakin Skywalker.

        Obi Wan is widely appreciated in the Star Wars fandom, especially the prequel fans. He is one of if not only the most
        loved character. For those who have no knowledge of SW universe, a short lists of his charm is compiled as below.
         <ul>
             <li>
                 <p>
                    His character arc spans a long period of time, in which the fate of the galaxy changes dramatically.
                    A dedicated Jedi Master, he is consistently <strong>patient, resilient, smart, caring, empathetic,
                        and attractive.
                    </strong>

                    Because Obi Wan appeared in the original Triology, the cast selection for the prequels underwent prudent consideration
                    process in which the crew quickly decided on Ewan McGregor, whose appearance in the movies are quickly mistaken for
                    Jesus in ordinary religious homes.

                   Many of the character's design appeals to virtues that are, although hard to achieve in real life, very definitive for
                   us. At a young age, he lost his teacher Qui Gon in a heated battle with a strong enemy. He chose to take the responsibility
                   of his teacher's last wish, to train Anakin as a Jedi padawan. During a heated civil war on a Spartan-cultured planet,
                   Obi Wan lost the woman he dedicated his emotions on. Finally, on the vocanic planet of Mustafar, he fought the fateful
                   duel with his own padawan, Anakin, after losing him to the Sith. After all these, he continued to not let his emotion take
                   over him. I've wanted to hold my shit together when things go wrong, and after following through his story, I find myself
                   more successful in doing so.
